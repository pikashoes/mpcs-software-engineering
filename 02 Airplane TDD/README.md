# Homework #2

**25 pts**

**Due: Thursday, Feb 9 5:29pm**

### Instructions

This assignment is designed to give you some practice at Test-Driven Development.

* Do not fork this repository.  Download this code using the green "Clone or Download" button on GitHub, then select "Download ZIP"; or, clone this repository and remove the git data (`rm -rf .git`).

* **IMPORTANT: Commit often!  I need to see the evolution of your design.**  Specifically, *commit your code every time you write a new failing test*.  It would also be great to commit every time the tests pass again, but I understand that might be a lot to keep track of.  (Do not worry if you forget to commit once or twice - I just want to make sure you're generally following TDD).

* Start by running the `ticketing.py` program like we did in class.  

### Requirements:

1. Read the attached REQUIREMENTS doc.

2. Implement as many of the ``Actions`` as you can, using TDD to drive the design of your solutions.

3. You have freedom with regard to the actual functionality.  I intentionally left the requirements a bit vague so you can have fun with it.  Don't feel you have to get very fancy, but I would like to see some creativity and effort.
Consider this project to be a real project and you've been hired to build
the first prototype for our airline.

Questions?  Hit me up on Piazza.  Happy coding!
